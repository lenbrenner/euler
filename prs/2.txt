The stack already contains examples of gRPC and Gorm in action. Here are some goals:
populate DB from a remote client
    align entities(stuff in the DB) with resources)stuff available through API)
    create a client to use protobuf code
    load data from the client into the DB
    store the data from the DB to a file on the client machine
